#### History
Cameron and Logan met online (on Tinder, embarrassingly enough) in 2017 and went out for pizza on their first date. Things went pretty well, so they just kept eating pizza together.
In May of 2019, they took a trip to London. After a bottle of wine at a little Italian Restaurant, Logan proposed time Cameron in their hotel room (she said yes).
